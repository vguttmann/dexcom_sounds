# dexcom_sounds
The alarm sounds from the original Dexcom app.

I got the sounds from the app by just extracting the APK (which is just a renamed zip folder), which as of itself would already violate Dexcoms ToS.

Since I already did something illegal because I wanted the sounds for my xDrip, I might as well make it as easy to use as possible.

You can use this for whatever project, no matter what, as stated in the license.
